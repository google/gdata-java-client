    <!-- ########## PAGE CONTENT ########## -->
    <h2 id="page_title">Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using the Google Base data API! By using the Google Base data
      API (the &quot;API&quot; or “Service”), you (&quot;You&quot;) accept and
      agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the &quot;Terms
      of Use&quot;). In addition, your use of the API is subject to the <a
href="http://base.google.com/base/terms_of_service.html">Google Base Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <h2>1. Service</h2>
    <p>1.1 Description of Service. The API consists of
      an API client library and associated documentation that allows You to provide
      content to, or display results from, the Google Base service, subject to
      the limitations and conditions described below</p>
    <p>The API may be used in connection with a software application or website.
      In order to obtain the API, You must have a Google Account. After supplying
      Google with Your account information and agreeing to the Terms of Use, You
      will be issued an alphanumeric key assigned to You by Google that is uniquely
      associated with your Google Account. Your application or site must utilize
      this key as described in the Google Base API documentation (which
      can be found at <a
href="index.html">http://code.google.com/apis/base</a>, or other URL as Google may decide from time to time),
      and Google may block requests with an invalid key. </p>
    <p>1.2 Modifications. Google reserves the right to
      release subsequent versions of the API and to require You to obtain and use
      the most recent version. Google may modify the Terms of Use at any time with
      or without notice, and You can review the most current version of the Terms
      of Use online at any time at <a
href="terms.html">terms</a> (other
      URL as Google may decide from time to time). If a modification is
      unacceptable to You, You may cancel the Service by stopping your use of the
      Service. If You continue to use the Service, You will be deemed to have accepted
      the modifications.</p>
    <p>1.3 Appropriate Conduct and Prohibited Uses.If
      you are displaying content from Google Base through the Service, You agree
      that you will not, and you will not permit your users or other third parties
      to: (a) modify or obscure the text, images, or other content of any Google
      Base content that you display on your site; or (b) modify, obscure or otherwise
      disable the functioning of links to Google or third party websites provided
      in the Google Base content.</p>
    <p>The API can be used to allow You or Your end users to provide content to Google
      Base and to allow your site or application to display search results from
      Google Base.  If you use the Service to display search results from Google
      Base, you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of the results,
      in accordance with Section 2.3 of these Terms of Use.</p>
    <p>If your application or site enables end users to provide content to Google
      Base, it must clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users that their
      content will be provided to Google and made available to the general public
      through the Google Base service.  Also, if your application or site enables
      end users to provide content to Google Base, it must use one of the user
      authentication methods set forth in the Google Base API documentation, and
      may not use any other method of collecting, transmitting, or receiving the
      Google Account name or password.  You may not use or share end user Google Account information
      for any purpose other than to implement the authentication methods set forth
      in the Google Base API documentation. If this Agreement is terminated for
      any reason, you agree to delete all end user Google Account information,
      including but not limited to usernames and passwords. You understand
      and agree that content submitted through the Service may be edited or removed
      from Google Base only as enabled by the Service or as described in the <a
href="http://base.google.com/base/terms_of_service.html">Google Base Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <p>You agree that You are responsible for your own conduct and content while
      using the Service and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the
      Service only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these
      Terms of Use and any applicable policies or guidelines. By way of example,
      and not as a limitation, You agree that when using the Service, You will
      not, and will not permit your end users or other third parties to:</p>

      grant or shall be deemed to grant to one party any right, title or interest
      in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by You of Google's Brand
      Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) shall inure to the

      at any time and for any reason, and such rejection shall render null and
      void the Terms of Use between You and Google. Google shall not be liable
      to You for damages of any sort resulting from its decision to reject such
      a request.</p>
    <p>8.4 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination
      of the Terms of Use for any reason (i) all license rights granted herein
      shall terminate and (ii) You shall immediately delete any and all Google
      Search Results and Google Brand Features.</p>
    <p>8.5 Survival. In the event of any termination or
      expiration of the Terms of Use for any reason, Sections 2.1, 2.2, 4, 5, 6,
      7, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 9 shall survive termination. Neither party shall be
      liable to the other party for damages of any sort resulting solely from terminating
      the Terms of Use in accordance with its terms.</p>
    <p>8.6 Remedies. You acknowledge that Your breach of
      service/license restrictions contained herein may cause irreparable harm
      to Google, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly,
      You agree that, in addition to any other remedies to which Google may be
      legally entitled, Google shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive
      relief in the event of a breach of such sections by You or any of Your officers,
      employees, consultants or other agents.</p>
    <p>8.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in the Terms
      of Use should be construed to confer any rights to third party beneficiaries.</p>

    <h2>9. General Information</h2>
    <p>Entire Agreement. The Terms of Service constitute
      the entire agreement between You and Google and govern your use of the Service,
      superseding any prior agreements between You and Google. You also may be
      subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use or
      purchase certain other Google services, affiliate services, third-party content
      or third-party software.</p>
    <p>Choice of Law and Forum. The Terms of Service
      and the relationship between You and Google shall be governed by the laws
      of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Google
      agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the
      county of
      Santa Clara,
      California.</p>
    <p>Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure
      of Google to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service
      shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
      of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
      be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor
      to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision,
      and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and
      effect.</p>
    <p>Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless
      of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
      out of or related to use of Google services or the Terms of Service must
      be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
      be forever barred.</p>
    <p>The section headings in the Terms of Service are for convenience only and
      have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
