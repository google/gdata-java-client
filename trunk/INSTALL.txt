  3. Ant build configuration to compile the source code.
  4. GData API documentation under "gdata/doc".
  5. Javadoc for client source under "gdata/java/doc".
  6. GData-enabled service specific samples under "gdata/java/sample".

REQUIREMENTS:

   Picasa Web Album API and YouTube Data API.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Update ant build configuration to point to right path for dependency jars.
1. Unpack gdata.java.zip package to local folder.
2. Edit the following lines in "gdata/java/build.properties" to point to 
   correct path for dependency jar files
    activation.jar=<path to activation.jar file>
    mail.jar=<path to mail.jar file>
    servlet.jar=<path to servlet.jar file>
    
EXECUTING SAMPLES:
------------------
GData-enabled service specific samples can be executed through ant build targets.
1. Edit "gdata/java/build.properties" file to specify input data
   for samples. This step is required only for samples that use user data
   from build.properties file.
2. To run a specific sample execute the ant run target corresponding to the sample.
   For example to execute calendar sample, run command "ant sample.calendar.run"
   from folder "gdata/java".
